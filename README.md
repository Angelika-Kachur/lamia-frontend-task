# Places App
This is a 'Places' application in which you can create new Places using UI or Map, edite and delete all Places.
I used Node.js for server part, JavaScript for UI, Sass to make styling faster, GoogleMapAPI for map and Mocha with Supertest to test the App.

## To run App
- yarn install
- yarn start (to run server)
- yarn test (to test app)
- yarn sass (to convert scss to css)
- open in your browser localhost:9000
